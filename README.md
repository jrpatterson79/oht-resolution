## Overview
The code in this repository is used to generate the analysis presented in Patterson and Cardiff (2025), _Multi‐frequency oscillatory hydraulic tomography improves heterogeneity imaging and resolution and reduces uncertainty_. This paper describes a suite of numerical oscillatory hydraulic tomography (OHT) experiments that explore imaging capabilities, parameter resolution, and parameter uncertainty associated with single- and multi-frequency oscillatory hydraulic tomograhpy (OHT). 
 
_All MATLAB scripts were developed using MATLAB 2021b and have recently been executed using MATLAB 2023b. Execution of these codes requires OHT v.0.16.0 which is available at https://github.com/wischydro-cardiff/oscillatory-tomography.git_
